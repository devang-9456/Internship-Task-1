General Security Risks of Open Ports

| Risk                            | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unauthorized Access**         | Attackers can connect to exposed services and try brute force, credential stuffing, or exploit vulnerabilities. |
| **Information Leakage**         | Some services expose version numbers and configurations, aiding reconnaissance.                                 |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)**     | Attackers can flood open ports to exhaust system resources.                                                     |
| **Malware Entry Points**        | Backdoors and malware often exploit open ports to gain or maintain access.                                      |
| **Pivoting & Lateral Movement** | Once inside, attackers can use open ports to move across the network.                                           |
